D20190127T231316:here note: this will be compiled as a C++ file even with
`nim c`, thanks to the extension (which clang/gcc understands);
however, in `nim c` mode this will fail in link phase
(which by default would use `clang/gcc`)
unless linker is overridden, see D20190127T231316.

cleaner alternative: compile `scanner.cc` into a shared library
that we link against, which avoids the linker hack.
